So there I was going down the rabbit hole of the interwebs late one night, I was scouring the web for god-knows-what, and I was at the bottom of a weboage and there was a pencil icon so I clicked it. and bam!! it transformed into Tina.. I was like holy sheep shit this is so dope, and that's how this all began.. _whowouldathunkit._..
